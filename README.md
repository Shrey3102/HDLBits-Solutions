# HDLBits-Solutions ⭐

This repository contains my solutions to the **HDLBits Verilog problem set**.

HDLBits is a widely used platform for practicing **Verilog and SystemVerilog**, covering topics from basic combinational logic to finite state machines and sequential design.

At the time of creating this repository, the HDLBits problem set consists of **~178 problems**, and this repository aims to provide **clear, correct, and synthesizable solutions** for all of them.

## Contents

The solutions are organized according to the HDLBits problem categories, including:

- Getting Started
- Basic Gates
- Vectors
- Multiplexers
- Arithmetic Circuits (Adders, Counters)
- Sequential Logic
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- More Advanced HDL Constructs

Each solution is written to be:
- **Synthesizable**
- **Readable**
- **Beginner-friendly**
- **Accepted by HDLBits**
